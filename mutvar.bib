  abstract={We have accumulated considerable data on the genetic makeup of the Icelandic population by sequencing the whole genomes of 2,636 Icelanders to depth of at least {10X} and by chip genotyping 101,584 more. The sequencing was done with Illumina technology. The median sequencing depth was {20X} and 909 individuals were sequenced to a depth of at least {30X.} We found 20 million single nucleotide polymorphisms {(SNPs)} and 1.5 million insertions/deletions (indels) that passed stringent quality control. Almost all the common {SNPs} (derived allele frequency {(DAF)} over 2\%) that we identified in Iceland have been observed by either {dbSNP} (build 137) or the Exome Sequencing Project {(ESP)} while only 60 and 20\% of rare {(DAF\{\textless\}0.5\%)} {SNPs} and indels in coding regions, the most heavily studied parts of the genome, have been observed in the public databases. Features of our variant data, such as the transition/transversion ratio and the length distribution of indels, are similar to published reports.},
